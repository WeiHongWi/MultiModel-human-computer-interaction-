## Introduction
Human interacted with environment with multimodals that processes their senses.For example,the dialogue between speaker and listener,when the messenge sent from speaker and the speech also sent the information of the speech to speaker so that he can realize the quality of his speech and may adjust some properties.So,by this idea,the research team previously presented the speech chain model, just like the figure below:
