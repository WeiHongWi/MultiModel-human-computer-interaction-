## Introduction
Human interacted with environment with multimodals that processes their senses.For example,the dialogue between speaker and listener,when the messenge sent from speaker and the speech also sent back  the speech to speaker so that he can realize the quality of his speech and may adjust some properties.So,by this idea,the research team previously presented the speech chain model, just like the figure below:

Furthermore,they thought the visual system will help the TTS and ASR to perform better.So,the number of chain became 3.just like the figure below:
